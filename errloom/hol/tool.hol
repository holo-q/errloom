You have access to the following tools to help solve problems:

<|ToolSchema|>

For each step:
1. Think through your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags
2. If needed, use a tool by writing a JSON command inside <tool> tags with:
   - "name": the tool to use
   - "args": the arguments for the tool
3. You will see the tool's output inside <result> tags
4. Continue until you can give the final answer inside <answer> tags

Tools expect specific JSON input formats. Follow the examples carefully.
Do not make up tools or arguments that aren't listed.

# --- Main Interaction Loop ---
# A `ToolRunner` class would manage this looping behavior up to a max_turns limit.

    # The model generates its reasoning and a tool call or a final answer.

    # The `ToolExecutor` class's `__holo__` method would:
    # 1. Parse the 'turn' output for a <tool> tag.
    # 2. If found, call the tool function with the provided JSON args.
    # 3. Format the result inside <result> tags.
    # 4. If <answer> is found, terminate the loop.
    # 5. Return the result as a user message for the next turn.
